# JavaLogger

There are a plenty of libraries to log messages. When we need to print some messages or values of variables, we can use those libraries. But those libraries are a little difficult :sob: to use because they have so many functionalities. I think it could be easier if those functionalities are separated, we can use those with default settings and we can only choose the libraries we just want simply. How we can implement those requirements will be our job. Let's use our brain‼✨
